# python-flask-machine-learning-models-rest-api


I bet after you've wandered here after reading all my in-depth and amazing blogs posts about my super cool machine learning models.
But after reading, you've been thinking, "I wish there a way I could use those models to make predictions on my own data."

Well look no further!

Here a Flask rest api app for accessing prediction data from all my Metis and personal machine learning algorithms.

This is launched on a Raspberry Pi server for the world to use!
